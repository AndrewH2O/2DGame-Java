Adding world map larger than screen and Camera
1) modify player class where the player is always at the center of the screen
2) expand the boundary of our tile drawing

We use worldX and WorldY - player position on world map but not on the screen
also screenX and screenY - for drawing, draw player at centre of screen
and scroll the background, the world map


TileManager in draw method we implemenent a camera which is a subset of the world
where the player is always at the center of the screen
things we need to do
1. Tile Image
2. x
3. y
