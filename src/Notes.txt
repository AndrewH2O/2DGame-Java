Treasure Hunting Game
3 keys and get treasure

Adding world map larger than screen and Camera
1) modify player class where the player is always at the center of the screen
2) expand the boundary of our tile drawing

We use worldX and WorldY - player position on world map but not on the screen
also screenX and screenY - for drawing, draw player at centre of screen
and scroll the background, the world map


TileManager in draw method we implemenent a camera which is a subset of the world
where the player is always at the center of the screen
things we need to do
1. Tile Image
2. x
3. y


Collison,
1) set flag on Tile
2) which part of player is colliding with the tile
    Not the whole char just part of it - helps with navigating narrow paths
    Say just body excl top of head and arms.
    An entity has a solid area.
    SolidArea rect is the area where the entity is solid.
    This isset within an entity. See subclass Player.
3) CollisionChecker is where we check for collision based on solid area and 2 neighbor tiles

I shrunk the SolidArea rect by 2 pixels as the original code prevented walking left and right along the path
